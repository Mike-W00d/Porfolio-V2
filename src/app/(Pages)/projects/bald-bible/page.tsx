      <span className='text-fedblue'> Our final group project while at Makers. Our team consisted of 4 software developers and 2 quality engineers, and we were given 8 days to reach MVP building anything we liked which we would then present to a live audience at the end of our course. We decided on to build Bald Bible to try and create a positive place on the internet for those suffering with hair loss. One of our team pitched the idea drawing from his own experience of losing his hair where all you see online when you google hair loss are websites selling you products to try preventing hair loss rather than encouraging you to embrace it.
